# Welcome

Welcome to algorithms and data structures! In an effort to better prepare you for technical interviews, we’ve assembled a list of readings and challenges for you to work through daily. Please note that this content is optional. You don’t need to complete it to progress through each Phase or graduate.

Since this content is optional, Ask a Question support will not be available. Please lean on your fellow students and the Internet for help.

We recommend going through the content in order. Always set a time limit, so you don’t spend too long on a single problem. Remember, your core coursework comes first! You can always work on this when you have free time or even after you graduate.
